Kafka is essentially a pub/sub messaging queue that can handle very high throughput due to some ingenious engineering and a trade off with durability. The system uses simpler storage logic that takes advantage of file system cache rather than implementing its own application-level cache. In addition, messages are always read sequentially, so all you need to save is an offset to where you want to start reading. These offsets are also stored by consumers -- the servers (or brokers, as they are called in Kafka) are stateless. The coordination in a distributed setting is simplified by using Zookeeper instead of a master node, and splitting each Kafka topic into partitions that can only be read by one consumer within a consumer group at any given time (avoids requiring locks or state management). Kafka guarantees at-least-once delivery and does not require an acknowledgement from the consumer (further enabling throughput to be much higher than traditional message queue systems). ",

        "description": "A seminal work in distributed systems. The Paxos Algorithm is a consensus algorithm used in fault-tolerant distributed systems. There are 3 roles: proposers, acceptors and learners. The gist of the algorithm is a proposer broadcasting a prepare request with number n to a the acceptors. If n is greater than the last prepare request the acceptor received, it responds to the proposer with a promise to not a accept any more proposals. Once the proposer receives a promise from a majority of acceptors, it sends an accept request to those acceptors with a proposal number n and value v. If the acceptor receives an accept request with value n, it accepts the proposal unless it has already promised for a prepare request with number greater than n. Finally, the acceptors respond with their acceptances to a set of \"distinguished learners\", which are then responsible for broadcasting the acceptance to the other learners.\n\nThere are obviously failure cases that the paper addresses and I have no included here. I found bits of the final part of the paper a little abstract and difficult to understand, but overall, a really concisely written paper.",

What I found especially interesting in this paper are the optimizations that are done for this to work at Google's scale (probabilistic feature inclusion, encoding values with 16 bits rather than 32/64 bits, etc). Lastly, I thought Google's automated feature management system is a great idea for how features (referred to as \\\"signals\\\" in the paper) can be shared and managed among different teams.
