    "author": "Alex Graves",
    "description": "I've only read the first 30 pages of Alex Graves' PhD thesis, but it's been a very clear and concise introduction to neural networks. I'd recommend it to anyone who has a shallow background in ML and wants to learn about neural nets."

    "author": "Paul Beatty",
    "description": "This is the first book by an American author to win a Man Booker. A very interesting work of satire. There were definitely some references which I did not understand, but Beatty writes beautifully (there were a number of times I paused reading to appreciate the literature)."

    "author": "Siddhartha Mukherjee",
    "description": "A fascinating description of the history of cancer, through discovery, research and treatments. Even though Mukherjee does really well to make scientific topics more accessible to non-technical readers, I think you'd get a little more out of the book if you have a background in biology (which I do not). Still a highly recommended read."
